assignment 8

My shiny page has 3 widgets that control the species being displayed, and the x and y axises respectively. It updates the title and labels based on the user input.


You can view my beautiful page [here.](https://rosemerryberry.shinyapps.io/assignment-8/)


Did you receive any help from others (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who.

Lauren helped me title my axes by linking me to the plotly documentation. 

2. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this challenge?

4

3. On a scale of 1 (too easy) to 10 (too challenging), how difficult was this challenge?

4, pretty basic, but the material wasn't that difficult and for 50 points I thought it was appropriate

4. Did you encounter any problems in this challenge we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the challenge better?

Yes, getting it up to an actual website/shiny app thing was frustrating and all I needed to do was libary everything on both the server and the ui.
